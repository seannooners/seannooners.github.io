### CPSC 120
*Lab 1

    Lab 1: I understand it’s a bit cliche, but before taking this class I primarily did my coding on CodeHS which took away the compiler and wasn’t connected to Git in any way. I won’t forget how happy I was figuring out how to connect and set up my computer to display the proper command using the terminal.
*Lab 4 Part 2

    Lab 4 Part 2: This lab to me was meaningful because it was like I was coding my own version of a mini-game. Using the if and else statements made my code seem to flow so much easier and was satisfying to use for the first time. I also wrote some pseudo-code for the first time in this class and it changed my entire perspective on writing pseudo-code before actually coding.
*Lab 7 Part 2

    Lab 7 Part 2: This lab was similar to Lab 4 but went further into depth. I really enjoy using if statements and the main function was primarily composed of those. Creating the functions in the parking_functions.cc was fun because I was primarily provided with only the parking signs with the times and creating boolean functions based on that was a satisfying challenge once I got it done.
